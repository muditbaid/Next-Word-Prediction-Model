### Next Word Prediction Model with TensorFlow

This repository implements a next-word prediction model using TensorFlow that generates the most likely following word in a sequence.

## Key Features

* **LSTM Recurrent Neural Network:** Employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture long-range dependencies in text sequences.
* **TensorFlow Tokenizer and Embeddings:** Utilizes TensorFlow's Tokenizer to transform text into numerical IDs and applies embedding layers to convert IDs into dense vectors.
* **Softmax Activation:** Employs a softmax activation layer to predict the probability distribution of the next word.
* **ReLu Activation:** Uses ReLU activation in hidden layers for efficient learning.

## Model Architecture

* **Input Layer:** Receives a sequence of word indices (integers) generated by the Tokenizer.
* **Embedding Layer:** Transforms integers into dense vectors representing word meanings.
* **LSTM Layer:** Captures long-range dependencies in the sequence and learns internal representations.
* **Hidden Layers with ReLU activation:** Additional layers process the LSTM output and extract further features.
* **Output Layer with Softmax activation:** Predicts the probability distribution of the next word in the sequence.

## Further Developments

* Implement beam search for generating multiple possible next words.
* Experiment with different activation functions and optimizers.
* Fine-tune the model on specific datasets for improved performance.
